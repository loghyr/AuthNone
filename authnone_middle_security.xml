    When describing the server behavior, the language in the various
    manpages are not clear on the difference between:

    <list style='hanging'>
      <t hangText='Wild Card'>
        The server bypasses any security authentication via the
        incoming request and simply anonymizes the credentials.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Anonymization'>
        The server first ensures all security authentication via the
        incoming request's security flavor and only if accepted does
        it anonymmize the credentials.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    In practice, the server should apply the authentication method
    requested by the client and only then anonymize the credentials.
  </t>

  <t>
    Another concern would be when the server returns an authentication
    list which just contains AUTH_NONE. Does that imply that the server
    supports all possible security flavors?
  </t>

  <t>
    The client can safely assume that the server supports both the
    security flavor it requested and AUTH_NONE. For example, if the
    server was not configured for Kerberos and hence did not have
    a valid ticket, it would not be able to process the incomming
    kerberized mount request from the client and would have not
    gotten down into the NFS/MOUNT layer to reply to the client
    with the list of security flavors.
