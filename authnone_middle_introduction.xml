    Security flavors for authentication of Network FileSystem (NFS)
    access are presented in <xref target="RFC1813" />. The extent of
    the description of AUTH_NONE (also AUTH_NULL in
    <xref target='RFC1057' />) is:

    <list>
      <t>
        The AUTH_NONE flavor provides null authentication, that
        is, no authentication information is passed.
      </t>
    </list>

    No guidance is provided for the behavior that many server
    vendors have implemented for exporting filesystems. Namely,
    that if the client mount request is with a security flavor
    that does not match one in the server export list, but the
    server export list does contain "-sec=none", then
    accept the mount request with anonymous credentials.
  </t>

    Before Sun Microsystems, Inc. passed the standards development
    of NFS to the IETF, vendors seeking compatibility followed
    <xref target="RFC1813" />, but would also adopt conventions
    found in the Solaris manpages. And while the both the NFS
    and MOUNT protocols were standardized in RFC1813, the exporting
    of filesystems by servers for sharing with clients was not.
    Hence, the share_nfs(1M) manpages of Solaris 2.6
    <xref target='S26RM97' /> are the first documentation which
    describes the behavior of AUTH_NONE when exported by a server.
  </t>

  <t>
    We have found however that not all client implementer have
    adopted this definition of the server behavior and want to
    see an informational ID that describes exactly what sort
    of behavior to expect from the server. I.e., they feel
    that if the server advertises that it supports AUTH_NONE,
    then that means that the client can only use a mount option
    of "sec=none" in order to access the exported filesystem.
