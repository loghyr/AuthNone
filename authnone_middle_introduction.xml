    Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have been mainstreamed in
    modern operating systems such as Linux (R), FreeBSD (R), and Solaris
    (TM).  MAC systems bind security attributes to
    subjects (processes) and objects within a system.  These attributes
    are used with other information in the system to make access control
    decisions.
